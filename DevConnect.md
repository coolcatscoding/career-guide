# What is DevConnect?

## Learning Competencies
- Research companies in DBC network
- Initiate communication to explore opportunities

## Summary
[DevConnect](https://connect.devbootcamp.com) is a platform that allows you to access Dev Bootcamp’s entire Employer Partner Network (primarily in San Francisco, Chicago & New York) of 600+ companies. Use [DevConnect](https://connect.devbootcamp.com) to explore companies and directly message their hiring manager or recruiter.

Companies cannot see you or your profile until you introduce yourself to them, so polish off your profile and start making intros to companies that interest you!

## Releases
### Release 0
[Login](https://connect.devbootcamp.com/profile) with your Launchpad credentials and you’ll be taken directly to your DevConnect profile page. Your profile (photo and personal information) will be imported from Launchpad. Use Launchpad to change any of that information and it will be reflected on DevConnect within 24 hours (the two systems sync overnight).

### Release 1
All the companies listed in DevConnect know what Dev Bootcamp has to offer and are excited to hire our grads! To get their attention, you’ll need to stand out from all the rest. Compared to other job search tools, this is your chance to showcase how your life beyond DBC makes you a uniquely ideal candidate.

### Release 2
For your passion statement, this is where you'll insert that one sentence overview from the What's Your Story session. Who are you, and why are you excited about a career in code? What inspires you to get out of bed? What keeps you up late into the night in your terminal? Avoid buzzwords and industry jargon. Embrace your quirks and what makes you different.

### Release 3
In the project section, describe your project purpose, technologies used, and personal contributions if it is a group project. You can also add screenshots. When you add a project, make sure the slider is green otherwise the employers you introduce yourselves to will not be able to see them.

### Release 4
Under previous experience, know that this is what sets you apart from other applicants. Tell your story of what you’ve done before Dev Bootcamp and how it applies to what you’re doing now. Think about skills you used at your previous experience that can be transferred over to your next job. Illustrate your points with stories or examples from your past to make it come alive!

### Release 5
Employers want to know that you’re always hungry to learn more. Share any new languages, frameworks, or other technologies that you want to add to your skillset. Share what projects you have in mind to build on these new skills.

### Release 6
Add some notables. This is truly your chance to show off your personality. This can include anything you want employers to know about you, from DBC, past jobs, or beyond! Start with certificates, awards, leadership, and accomplishments. Then dig deep - think of interesting quirks, hobbies, interests, travel, or anything else that says something unique about you. Some fan favorites are, “Bakes a perfect souffle, every time,” and “Has read a history book every month for the last five years.” You do you!

### Release 7
Languages/Technologies can be helpful to organize into sublists of languages, frameworks, and technologies.

### Release 8

Start your search by using the following Search Fields:

- First, search by companies that are “hiring now”
- Second, search by the location that you would like to work in (search by San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, San Mateo, Sunnyvale, Mountain View, etc. so you don’t miss any!)

### Release 9
On a company profile page, select Request Introduction under the company name. You can then navigate to the Introductions page from the left menu. Here you’ll see all the companies that you have already used Introductions to contact. When you click on a company’s logo, you will be sent to a message thread between you and that company. Use this page to submit a personalized message to explain why you are excited about that company specifically, and what you have to offer. We recommend sending a follow up message if you don’t hear back within 3-5 business days.

Your local Career Developer will give you 3 introductions to start. Email for more introductions. If you or a company indicates that you are not interested in moving forward, your intro will be automatically replaced. If a company does not respond within seven days to an intro, your intro will also be automatically replaced. You should always have three intros “in play.”
