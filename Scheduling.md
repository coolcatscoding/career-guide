Establish your weekly goals

## Release 1
Break down weekly goals to daily goals. For example, your weekly goal may be to send 15 cold outreach emails, attend three events, complete week 1 data structure/algorithm challenges; daily goals may be to spend four hours coding, 1 hour researching XYZ company and team, 2 hours sending cold outreach, 1 hour company research, have a conversation with one new person.

## Release 2
Once you've established your weekly and daily goals, build your days out for a minimum of an eight-hour work day. Timebox each task. Physically schedule these tasks on your calendar and/or to-do list. Learning how to maintain your schedule via your calendar is an important skill and it will help you maintain your momentum throughout your job search and stay organized. When you have something to work towards each day, your days will seem a lot more productive.
