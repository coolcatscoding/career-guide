## Releases

### Release 0
Take a look at a few examples before getting started:

 - [Theo Skolnik](http://www.theoskolnik.com/resume/theoskolnik.pdf) (DBC alumna)
 - And one more [resume](https://resume.creddle.io/resume/b8ixbeqr1rt)
 - Don't be afraid to think outside of the box...Check out this [epic resume.](http://www.rleonardi.com/interactive-resume/)
 - BUT if traditional is more your style, here's a more [traditional resume example](./Resources/resume_layout_examples_sept2015.pdf) a great example of your basic resume.

### Release 1
You can choose to set up a traditional resume, but first take a look at [creddle.io](http://creddle.io) for creating a fresh layout.

### Release 2
Add a __Header:__ Name, phone number, email, GitHub, LinkedIn, personal site (These should all be linked text, not the long URL strings)

### Release 3
Add an __About Me__ section with the 1 - 3 sentence intro you created in [What's Your Story](/Your_Story.md)

### Release 4
Add a __Skills__ section: Highlight your dev/technical skills first. Include any transferable skills in this section as well.

### Release 5
Add a __Projects__ section. What are you proud of? Show it off!

Be sure to include the following four elements for each project on your resume:

* __What does your application do?__ What problem does it solve for the end user? Who is it built for?
* __In what period of time was it built?__ This helps set folks' expectations appropriately. A product built in two months should look a lot more polished than one built in two weeks.
* __What was your role in the project?__ Front end? Testing? Team lead?
* __Technologies used__ This might be the most brag-worthy part for you, but since this element is likely the longest of the four, leave it for the end. Go nuts - dive into what API's, frameworks and languages you incorporated.

Does each project on your resume link to a GitHub repo? Does the ReadMe for each project include screenshots of the application in action?

Think back to your countless experiences in the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. Would you even _consider_ trying out an application without screenshots to tell you what it looks like? Nope.

### Release 6
Add an __Experience__ section.

* Lead with your position title, then the company name
* Use dates
* Add Dev Bootcamp under Experience
* Maximum of 3-4 bullet points per position
* Each bullet should be value-driven rather than task-oriented.
* Answer the questions: _What did you accomplish in this position?_ or _What are you most proud of?_ rather than, _What were your boring day-to-day duties?_

### Release 7
Add an __Education__ section to the bottom of the resume. If you choose to add Dev Bootcamp, keep it short and sweet, such as: "19 week web development intensive program." Remove GPAs and list in reverse chronological order, from the most recent to the least recent.

### Release 8
Exchange resumes with (2) peers from your cohort. Share written feedback that you can refer back to.

### Release 9
