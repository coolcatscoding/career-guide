# Prep

Remember to take a moment to review the [Graduate Agreement](https://rightsignature.com/forms/2016-Graduate-Agr-87faa5/token/b3523f08a9a) and return signed by Monday morning before we get started. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out!

As I mentioned, you'll be receiving an email from me asking for student information. In that email it'll mention that we'll be running from Tuesday - Friday (replace "Tuesday" with "Monday" in your mind for me). Do fill out that student form before we get started Monday morning.

Remember, we'll be on the back couches Monday morning then in the Great Hall the rest of the week.

Complete before we start @ 9:30am Monday morning:

* Review and sign this [Graduate Agreement form](https://rightsignature.com/forms/2016-Graduate-Agr-87faa5/token/b3523f08a9a)
* Complete Graduate Information Form, coming to your inbox from Lia
* [This activity](./Resources/WCIYP) will be the first workshop Monday morning. Be sure to complete the [Printable Petal Exercise](./Resources/WCIYP/Blank Flower Diagram.pdf) from Chapter 7
* Complete your resume using these [Tech Resume Guidelines](./Resume.md)
* Complete your LinkedIn using these [LinkedIn Guidelines](./LinkedIn.md)
* Complete your DevConnect profile using these [DevConnect Guidelines](./DevConnect.md)
* Build your [company tracker](./Organized_Searching.md) with trello.
* Answer the questions asked for the ["Your Story"](./Your_Story.md) exercise

**Pro-Tips**

* Spend ~15-20 minutes on each petal (there are seven), you can always come back to one or two later on
* Ignore the prioritizing grid, it's too time consuming
* Petal 3 can be a time suck. Think of several scenarios but don't feel the need to come up with​ seven​ detailed ones, the skills are more important than separate situations to pull them from.
* Petal 5 is a good basic financial planning exercise, if you haven't gone through something like it recently, it could be helpful
* ​Petal 7 is deep - ​read over the prompt, give yourself time to reflect and come up with your "kingdom.​"
