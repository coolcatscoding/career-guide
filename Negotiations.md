- Navigate multiple offers
- Navigate offer while still in interview process with other companies

## Summary

For some reason we live in a world that is afraid to talk openly about money. That changes for you today. In this session we'll have an open discussion about averages our alums are currently making in full-time junior developer jobs, apprenticeships, internships, and contract/freelance opportunities.

## Objectives
- When you receive an offer, do not accept on the spot. You don't even have to negotiate on the spot. Say thank you so much for this opportunity! I need to take some time to review the offer (you can say with your partner, mentor, etc. if you don't feel comfortable leaving it open ended). Could you send me the offer in writing so I can review it?
- Always negotiate in person or via phone, never through email.
- If you are in other interviews, let them know you've received an offer letter, but that you're most interested in an opportunity with their company, could they let you know a timeline for making a hiring decision so you could let the other company know when you could make your decision by. (Always do this verbally -- never through email.)
- When you find out timelines from the other companies you're interviewing with, let the company know who originally offered you that you're very thankful and excited for the opportunity, however you're deep in the process with "x number" of companies and it's too early into your career to burn any bridges, you'd like to honor the process. Could you give them an answer by "X" date? (Always do this in person or via phone so the hiring manager can hear you're sincere).
- Eliminate passive language when negotiating, but always be generous and respectful.
- Never ask for more than 10k more than what they asked for you, unless rare circumstance that we've discussed prior to neogitating.
