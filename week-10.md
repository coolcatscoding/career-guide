## Pre-work

### Core

**Prep for Monday**
* [This activity](./Resources/WCIYP) will be the first workshop Monday morning. Be sure to complete the [Printable Petal Exercise](./Resources/WCIYP/Blank Flower Diagram.pdf) from Chapter 7
* Complete your resume using these [Tech Resume Guidelines](./Resume.md)
* Complete your LinkedIn using these [LinkedIn Guidelines](./LinkedIn.md)
* Build your [company tracker](./Organized_Searching.md) with trello.
* Answer the questions asked for the ["Your Story"](./Your_Story.md) exercise

**Pro-Tips**

* Spend ~15-20 minutes on each petal (there are seven), you can always come back to one or two later on
* Ignore the prioritizing grid, it's too time consuming
* Petal 3 can be a time suck. Think of several scenarios but don't feel the need to come up with​ seven​ detailed ones, the skills are more important than separate situations to pull them from.
* Petal 5 is a good basic financial planning exercise, if you haven't gone through something like it recently, it could be helpful
* ​Petal 7 is deep - ​read over the prompt, give yourself time to reflect and come up with your "kingdom.​"
