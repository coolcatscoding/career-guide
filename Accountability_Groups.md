# Accountability Groups

## Learning Competencies
- Assemble support network for more effective career search
- Detect best practices for providing support for one another during the highs and lows of career search
- Establish standing weekly meetings for evaluating progress in career search

## Summary
We ask all graduates to actively participate in their assigned Careers Accountability Groups until everyone in their group is employed.

## Objectives

In order to have successful meetings we suggest setting an agenda, expectations for meeting outcomes, and alternating who will faciliate each meeting (each of you should lead at least one meeting).
