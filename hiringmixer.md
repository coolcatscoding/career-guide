## Presentation Protips
- Presentations should be about 7 minutes long
- Please use a simple slide deck to keep the audience engaged and focused
- Please discuss what you contributed to the group/project
- Create a slide that shows (by logos or a list) all the different technologies/languages/frameworks your group used
- Introduce your entire team at the start of your presentation
- Your presentation will be for a mix of technical and non-technical guests, it's great to discuss code and algorithms, but keep it light
- Presentations work best when they tell a story
- End your presentation with a final slide with contact information
- No Q&A after presentation, use this as a segue while networking
