# Personal Sites

This is a stretch activity, because developing a personal site is <b>NOT</b> going to get you the job, it is just a supporting document. Do not wait to apply to jobs until this is complete, again, this will not get you the job, it's just a nice add-on :)

### Pro-tips:
- Build it yourself as opposed to hosting it on a templated site like Wordpress.
- Make your resume easily accessible and downloadable.
- Be conscious of your UX/UI.
- Display your projects.
- Demonstrate your capabilities rather than just tell your viewers.
