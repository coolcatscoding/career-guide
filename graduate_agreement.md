# Dev Bootcamp Career Services

## Agreements and Expectations

Congratulations on graduating from Dev Bootcamp! This is a huge accomplishment, and is telling of your drive and passion. As hard as that was, the next phase of your journey will be even tougher – landing a great job! The Career Team and the DBC community are ready and waiting to support you while you search for your first job in the tech industry!

To gain access to these free resources for your job search, you will need to agree to some tenets along the same lines as the Student Handbook. Read below to learn how to get started.

### What Role Will Career Coaches Play in My Job Search?
Career Coaches first lay the foundation for a successful job search during Career Week through guided workshops and activities. Our graduates gain job seeking tools and strategies that are considered to be best practices in the field of career counseling. Graduates also learn how to prepare for the more technical aspects of the job search process. Support systems are set in place through accountability groups, community events, newsletters, weekly feedback forms, and ongoing 1:1 appointments with Career Coaches to provide personalized attention during the emotionally challenging process of job searching.

#### The First Agreement: Integrity
In simplest form, this means being honest. One way to embody integrity is doing what you say you are going to do. We will ask the following of you, and expect you to be in integrity by:

- Completing all forms requested by your Career Coach
- Attending the entirety of Career Week or making arrangements with your Career Coach
- Being on time for appointments and meetings
- Providing at least two hours’ notice when cancelling 1:1 appointments
- Reaching out to your Career Coach when you are struggling
- Updating the Career Team with your employment news
- Utilizing provided resources and asking for help

### The Second Agreement: Kindness
We also expect every person to be kind to one another. Kindness is not synonymous with niceness; they are actually not the same thing. Being kind does mean being friendly, generous, and considerate; it also means giving constructive, truthful feedback as long as it is Actionable, Specific, and Kind (ASK). This might also include a difficult, but necessary, conversation.

We expect everyone at DBC to show kindness by providing constant feedback to one another, holding each other accountable to upholding the Three Agreements, and by bringing 100% of ourselves into each and every day. We also show kindness through showing respect to others and our space.
Last but not least, we expect you to be kind to yourself. Job hunting is emotionally draining and it is easy to succumb to the judgments of your inner critic. Be compassionate and patient with yourself as you progress through your job search.

### The Third Agreement: Whole Self
We expect you to bring your intelligence, focus, creativity, and personality into each of your 1:1 appointments, workshops, office hours, and accountability group meetings during your job search. If you are struggling, we expect you to ask others (e.g. the Career Team, cohort members, alumni, your personal circle of support) for help. If something is holding back your participation, we ask that you focus on being authentic and honest. DBC flourishes when all of us feel safe with each other, and we all bring wisdom from our lives and experiences outside of DBC. This includes exposing your ignorance and being open to the uncomfortable emotional and technical challenges of job seeking.

If at any time you are not upholding any of these agreements, you risk losing the support of Career Services. This will be at the discretion of your Career Coach and the Head of Career Services. Those who lose their privileges may be granted one repeat which will provide an additional opportunity to receive support from Career Services moving forward.

### What Can You Expect From the Career Team?
Just as we ask for your agreement, you in turn can expect to work with a dedicated Career Coach who is committed to upholding some important terms. We will hold ourselves to the following standards in our work with you and other graduates.

When providing services, Career Coaches will:

- provide information and feedback
- share job search and event resources when applicable
- bring Whole Self to Career Week, 1:1 appointments, and other events
incorporate feedback

If at any time, you are concerned about the support you are receiving from career services, please email <a href="mailto:careers@devbootcamp.com">careers@devbootcamp.com</a>.

We look forward to working with you on your career goals!
