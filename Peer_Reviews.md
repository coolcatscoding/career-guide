#Peer Reviews

### Resume Review -
Review and give resume feedback. While reviewing, consider these questions:

- Does the resume include the basic essentials discussed?
- Does the resume encompass transferrable skills?
- Is the resume one page for every ten years?
- Are the bullet points action oriented?
- Do projects link out?
- Are there things you know about your pair that you don't get from reading their resume?



### LinkedIn Review -

Similar to the Resume Review, review and give LinkedIn feedback. While reviewing, consider these questions:

- Is there a title that makes sense and is effectively branding your partner?
- Have they created a vanity URL?
- Is the experience written anecdotally rather than bullet points?=
- Does the summary tell an effective story of how they got to a place where they're now applying for a dev role?
- Do they have a professional headshot?
- Is it inviting viewers to connect with?

Once you have completed two pair reviews for your resume and two pair reviews for your LinkedIn, implement these changes.

Once you feel it's employer ready, send it to Lia@devbootcamp.com. You get one resume review + one LinkedIn review from your local Career Developer. Be sure to take advantage of it!
