## Summary

It's time to learn how to find opportunities without pigeon holing yourself to career sites and job posting.

- Check out the [Finding New Opportunities's](./Resources/company_research.pdf) slide deck for more research support.

## Objectives

Focus on finding companies and people you'd like to work with or for, don't get side track with whether or not they have job listings posted that match your skillset.

## Releases

### Release 0

- Navigate to Meetup.com
- Search for groups local to the area you’re interested in working (i.e. ruby, javascript, etc.), be sure to select groups.
- On the group page two things will be very useful to the search: the Organizers list and the upcoming events.
- First check out who the organizers are. Where do they work? What other meetups are they active in? Where do they work? Are any of these companies of interest?
- Now navigate to the RSVP list. Who else is going? What companies do they work for? These are great resources for finding companies that you may be interested in working for!

### Release 1

- Navigate to LinkedIn.com
- Search for people to connect with that work for companies you’re interested in by typing the search box the name of the company. As you type a drop down selection of “People who work at…” will appear. Select that option.
- Narrow it down by the location where you’d like to work.
- Then narrow it down by industry - computer software.
- Now click through the results and determine whom you feel you can build a relationship with. When you find one, research them.
- When you feel like you know what you need to, write a personalized connection message to them with a call to action.
- You can also click on the company’s page and in the bottom right corner click: “People Also Viewed…” to find companies similar to this company.

### Release 2

- Navigate to Google
- Pick a location you’re interested in exploring opportunities.
- Search “top tech companies in [location]”
- Look for a journalist-generated list of companies that are recommended in that area.
- Pick a couple companies to look into with the students.
- Walk through the about page, careers page, and team page
- Show them how you then research these people on LinkedIn, Twitter, and look for a personal blog by this person/people
- Work through a solution together on how you’ll build a connection with someone from that company

### Release 3

- Add companies to your trello icebox

Additionally, here are some job boards that won't be featured in this afternoon's talk. Remember, the spray and pray method of applying to multiple jobs online and never reaching out to someone in the actual organization rarely lands you a job. It's better to use these posts as a way to find interesting companies to add to your tracker.
